# Profile Card Component

![Design preview for the Profile card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

**To do this project, I used a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

The final project is a bit different from the preview, I improved my work in 2021.


## Where to find everything

The designs are inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The assets are inside the `/images` folder.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information such as color palette and fonts.
